    <h2>A Brief History</h2> <!--This explains the history of the hotel and the paranormal activity-->
        <p>The Stanley Hotel has had records of paranormal activity since 1911. It all started when Elizabeth Wilson, a housekeeper was electrocuted during a lightening storm. She didn't die, but ever since the incident, her room, Room 217, has been a hotbed for paranormal activity. It has since been the most requested room in the hotel. Every room in the hotel has experienced something spooky throughout the years. Guests have reported that their bags have been mysteriously unpacked, lights have been turned on and off, even hearing childrens' laughter on the fourth floor.</p>
        
    <h2>The Shinning</h2> <!--This is talking about the book not the movie-->
        <p>Ever heard of the book The Shining? Well, the author Stephen King found his inspiration at the Stanley hotel during his stay in 1973. Luckily for him, King and his wife were the only guests at the hotel that night, but King was never convinced they were actually alone. King stayed in Room 217 and legend has it he encounted ghostly children wandering throughout the halls. His novel was inspired by the paranormal activity of the hotel. It describes the tricks ones mind can play on them when exposed to fear and paranoia. </p>
